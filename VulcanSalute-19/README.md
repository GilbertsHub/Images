## Reply

A lesser known cannon reply is "peace and long life" though as a Star Wars fan, and
a fan of mashups, I might suggest a reply of "may your Health be with you".

## Notes On Vulcan Salute 

For more on the Vulcan Salute visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcan_salute

The goal is to present a friendly alternate to touch handshakes.

Another alternate is bowing, which George Washington used as was the custom among
Gentlemen, of at least Verginia. See https://www.constitutionfacts.com/us-founding-fathers/fascinating-facts/
and search for "bowing".

## Credits, License, and Trademarks

As I am making no claim of ownership of anything Vulcan or Star Trek> I place no restrictions on the use of my material. Use of CBS’s material is up to their policy which seems to allow for non-profit fan art. My use is fair use "fan art" and I make no claim on them. Title and ownership remains with CBS.

The original salute and "live long and prosper" are from the original Star Trek television series and are trademarked by CBS Studios. 

The overall idea and words come from an internet meme I can not trace back to the original creator for credit. The text itself has been greatly changed. The basic image has also been changed to be a mashup of distortions of my hand, with some features of Leonard Nemoy’s hand in the Wikipedia article, and my poor artwork skills.
